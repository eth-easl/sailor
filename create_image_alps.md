Assuming a partition X

1. Get a compute node: `srun -t 5:00:00 -A a-infra02 --container-writable --pty bash`

2. Clone the sailor repo `git clone https://github.com/eth-easl/sailor.git && cd sailor `

3. While in the folder with the Dockerfile, create a new a new image (adjust the name as you want)
`podman build -t test:v1 .`

4. You can see your image now using this command
`podman images`

5. use enroot to export the image into a squash file
`enroot import -o test.sqsh podman://test:v1`

6. Make it readable
`setfacl -b test.sqsh && chmod 755 test.sqsh`

7. Create a .toml file like the one in clariden_script/sailor.toml

8. To get a container with the image running and get a shell

`srun  -t 5:00:00  --container-writable --environment=/capstor/scratch/cscs/fstrati/sailor/test.toml  --pty bash`
